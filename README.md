# Artificial Neural Network Hyperparameter Optimization using Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm 

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) to optimize the hyperparameters of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The MOGA aims to maximize accuracy and minimize loss simultaneously.

## Repository Structure

- **Data/**: Contains the initial data preprocessing code and the dataset.
- **Frontend_UI/**: Contains the code for implementing the user interface.
- **base_ann_model.ipynb**: This notebook contains the base ANN model without any optimization, serving as a baseline for comparison with the optimized model.
- **moga_optimized_model.ipynb**: This notebook implements the Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for optimizing the ANN's hyperparameters.
